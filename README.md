# runescape
auto clicker
use legacy interface mode (better mode imo)
start with spell book, trouble using action bar due to the changing background causing different colors, resulting in no match found
Use at own risk as Runescape does not support bots/scripts. 
Use in short durations (used for 2 hours on another account and no ban)
#My monitor is aspect ratio is 21*9 so you'll have to change the ratio for the pixel locations depending on your monitor.
